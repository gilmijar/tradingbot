# imperative overrides algo signals
# use it when a sell or buy is needed no matter the market situation

# imperative values: 0 - auto; 1 - buy; 2- sell; 3 - both; 4 - none

# auto trades normally - no imperative
# buy and sell do only buying and selling respectively
# both = janusz
# none no trading at all, even if there are signals
